# Workflows, Queues, and Cron Triggers

Read this reference only when the application needs durable, asynchronous, or
scheduled work. These are three independent features and may be combined.
They use Cloudflare Workers authoring contracts; do not create a SmallForce
wrapper API.

The template's `src/background.ts` is bundled beside Astro's HTTP handler and
re-exported by the final Worker module. Keep Astro pages and API routes in
`src/pages`; put Workflow classes plus default Queue and Cron handlers in
`src/background.ts`.

## Declare the runtime types

Add explicit bindings and shared payload types to `src/env.d.ts`:

```ts
type OrderWorkflowParams = { orderId: string };
type JobMessage = { jobId: string; kind: "sync" | "notify" };

interface SmallForceApplicationEnv {
  // Existing SmallForce bindings stay here.
  ORDER_WORKFLOW: Workflow<OrderWorkflowParams>;
  JOBS: Queue<JobMessage>;
  [name: string]: unknown;
}
```

The template includes `@cloudflare/workers-types`; do not add Wrangler.

## Workflows

Declare each Workflow binding in `smallforce.json`:

```json
{
  "workflows": [
    {
      "name": "order-processing",
      "binding": "ORDER_WORKFLOW",
      "class_name": "OrderWorkflow"
    }
  ]
}
```

Export the named class from `src/background.ts`:

```ts
import {
  WorkflowEntrypoint,
  type WorkflowEvent,
  type WorkflowStep,
} from "cloudflare:workers";

export class OrderWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint<
  SmallForceApplicationEnv,
  OrderWorkflowParams
> {
  async run(event: WorkflowEvent<OrderWorkflowParams>, step: WorkflowStep) {
    const order = await step.do("load order", async () => {
      return this.env.DB.query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = ?", [
        event.payload.orderId,
      ]);
    });
    await step.sleep("cooldown", "5 minutes");
    return order;
  }
}

export const background: ApplicationBackgroundHandlers<JobMessage> = {};
```

Start instances from a server-only Astro page or API route through the typed
`env.ORDER_WORKFLOW` binding. Celld owns durable steps, retries, sleeps, events,
pause/resume, restart, and crash replay. SmallForce resolves the environment's
current release whenever the Workflow wakes. Keep the Workflow `name`,
`class_name`, and persisted step history compatible while instances remain
active.

## Queues

Declare producers and same-application consumers separately:

```json
{
  "queues": {
    "producers": [{ "binding": "JOBS", "queue": "jobs" }],
    "consumers": [
      {
        "queue": "jobs",
        "max_batch_size": 25,
        "max_batch_timeout": 5,
        "max_retries": 3,
        "retry_delay": 10,
        "dead_letter_queue": "jobs-dead-letter"
      },
      { "queue": "jobs-dead-letter" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Send from server-only code:

```ts
await env.JOBS.send({ jobId: crypto.randomUUID(), kind: "sync" });
```

Implement the default Queue handler through `background`:

```ts
export const background: ApplicationBackgroundHandlers<JobMessage> = {
  async queue(batch, env, ctx) {
    for (const message of batch.messages) {
      await processJob(env, message.body);
      message.ack();
    }
    ctx.waitUntil(recordDelivery(batch.queue, batch.messages.length));
  },
};
```

Normal return plus resolved `ctx.waitUntil()` work acknowledges delivery.
Thrown or rejected work retries according to the current release's policy.
Delivery is at least once, has best-effort ordering, and runs the environment's
currently deployed release. Make every external side effect idempotent. V1
supports same-application push consumers and dead-letter Queues, not pull or
cross-application consumers.

## Cron Triggers

Declare UTC expressions with the standard Wrangler manifest shape:

```json
{
  "triggers": {
    "crons": ["*/5 * * * *", "0 9 * * MON-FRI"]
  }
}
```

Add the default scheduled handler to `background`:

```ts
export const background: ApplicationBackgroundHandlers<JobMessage> = {
  scheduled(controller, env, ctx) {
    ctx.waitUntil(runMaintenance(env, controller.scheduledTime));
  },
};
```

Cron Triggers support one-minute granularity and run the environment's current
release. Delivery and `ctx.waitUntil()` are at least once. A handler may call
`controller.noRetry()` when retrying would be unsafe, but the next scheduled
occurrence still runs. Keep scheduled side effects idempotent.

## Deploy all features together

Run the template build and deploy once:

```sh
bun run build
smallforce app deploy --json
```

Astro HTTP code, assets, Workflow definitions, Queue configuration, and Cron
Triggers are one immutable release. Preview activates automatically;
Production requires an explicit release promotion.
