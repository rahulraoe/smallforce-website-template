# Workflows, Queues, and Cron Triggers

Read this reference only when the application needs durable, asynchronous, or
scheduled work. These are three independent features and may be combined.
They use Cloudflare Workers authoring contracts; do not create a SmallForce
wrapper API.

Binding access is identical across execution types: Queue and Cron handlers
receive the public environment as `env`, Workflow classes receive it as
`this.env`, and server-only code in any of those paths may import `env` from
`cloudflare:workers`. Do not use `context.env`, `ctx.env`, or private
`__SMALLFORCE_*` bindings.

## Declare the runtime types

Add explicit producer and Workflow bindings to `AppEnv` in `src/runtime.ts`.
Keep message and parameter types strongly typed:

```ts
export type OrderWorkflowParams = { orderId: string };
export type JobMessage = { jobId: string; kind: "sync" | "notify" };

export type AppEnv = {
  // Existing SmallForce bindings stay here.
  ORDER_WORKFLOW: Workflow<OrderWorkflowParams>;
  JOBS: Queue<JobMessage>;
  [name: string]: unknown;
};
```

The template includes `@cloudflare/workers-types`; do not add Wrangler.

## Workflows

Declare each Workflow binding in `smallforce.json`:

```json
{
  "workflows": [
    {
      "name": "order-processing",
      "binding": "ORDER_WORKFLOW",
      "class_name": "OrderWorkflow"
    }
  ]
}
```

Export the named class from `src/background.ts`:

```ts
import {
  WorkflowEntrypoint,
  type WorkflowEvent,
  type WorkflowStep,
} from "cloudflare:workers";
import type {
  AppEnv,
  ApplicationBackgroundHandlers,
  JobMessage,
  OrderWorkflowParams,
} from "./runtime";

export class OrderWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint<
  AppEnv,
  OrderWorkflowParams
> {
  async run(event: WorkflowEvent<OrderWorkflowParams>, step: WorkflowStep) {
    const order = await step.do("load order", async () => {
      return this.env.DB.query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = ?", [
        event.payload.orderId,
      ]);
    });
    await step.sleep("cooldown", "5 minutes");
    return order;
  }
}

export const background: ApplicationBackgroundHandlers<JobMessage> = {};
```

Start and inspect instances through the binding from ordinary application code:

```ts
const instance = await env.ORDER_WORKFLOW.create({
  id: `order-${orderId}`,
  params: { orderId },
});
const existing = await env.ORDER_WORKFLOW.get(instance.id);
const status = await existing.status();
```

Celld owns durable steps, retries, sleeps, events, pause/resume, restart, and
crash replay. SmallForce resolves the environment's current release whenever
the Workflow wakes. Keep the Workflow `name`, `class_name`, and persisted step
history compatible while instances remain active.

## Queues

Declare producers and same-application consumers separately:

```json
{
  "queues": {
    "producers": [{ "binding": "JOBS", "queue": "jobs" }],
    "consumers": [
      {
        "queue": "jobs",
        "max_batch_size": 25,
        "max_batch_timeout": 5,
        "max_retries": 3,
        "retry_delay": 10,
        "dead_letter_queue": "jobs-dead-letter"
      },
      { "queue": "jobs-dead-letter" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Send from HTTP, Workflow, Queue, or Cron code:

```ts
await env.JOBS.send({ jobId: crypto.randomUUID(), kind: "sync" });
```

Implement the default Queue handler through `background`:

```ts
export const background: ApplicationBackgroundHandlers<JobMessage> = {
  async queue(batch, env, ctx) {
    for (const message of batch.messages) {
      await processJob(env, message.body);
      message.ack();
    }
    ctx.waitUntil(recordDelivery(batch.queue, batch.messages.length));
  },
};
```

Normal return plus resolved `ctx.waitUntil()` work acknowledges delivery.
Thrown or rejected work retries according to the current release's policy.
Delivery is at least once, has best-effort ordering, and runs the environment's
currently deployed release. Make every external side effect idempotent. V1
supports same-application push consumers and dead-letter Queues, not pull or
cross-application consumers.

## Cron Triggers

Declare UTC expressions with the standard Wrangler manifest shape:

```json
{
  "triggers": {
    "crons": ["*/5 * * * *", "0 9 * * MON-FRI"]
  }
}
```

Add the default scheduled handler to `background`:

```ts
export const background: ApplicationBackgroundHandlers<JobMessage> = {
  scheduled(controller, env, ctx) {
    ctx.waitUntil(runMaintenance(env, controller.scheduledTime));
  },
};
```

Cron Triggers support one-minute granularity and run the environment's current
release. Delivery and `ctx.waitUntil()` are at least once. A handler may call
`controller.noRetry()` when retrying would be unsafe, but the next scheduled
occurrence still runs. Keep scheduled side effects idempotent.

## Deploy all features together

Run `bun run check`, `bun test`, and `bun run build`, then deploy once:

```sh
smallforce app deploy --json
```

The Worker, Workflow definitions, Queue configuration, and Cron Triggers are
one immutable release. Preview activates automatically; Production requires an
explicit release promotion.
